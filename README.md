## simple front-end layout 
---

trying to make that looks good and make it as fast as i can, but the main goal of this practice is to make sure i write a good code and test the well documented practice 


objectives :
-  make a responsive layout using native tools (media queries).
-  consturct the site using a grid layout instead of bootstrap or other frameworks.
- follow a well established css naming convenstion (BEM modele).
-  judge and determain the pros and cons of the BEM convenstion.
